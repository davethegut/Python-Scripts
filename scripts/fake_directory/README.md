### Reason for this Directory 

This directory serves a purpose to educate users on the danger and power of malware scripts. Provided here are text sample files and a encrypt and decrypt script.

Feel free to download this repo and test it out for yourself and suggest and updates or changes that you think could improve it.

I also wanted to test out the import feature in python, as well as educate myself on the encryption potential of fernet.

*The purpose of this guide is to show you how malware works and how it is run; not to encourage users to reproduce this in a live environment "in the wild." As security professionals it is our job to understand how this dangerous stuff works, but to only use it in safe environments for the purpose of learning, and that's it. Please script responsibly.*
